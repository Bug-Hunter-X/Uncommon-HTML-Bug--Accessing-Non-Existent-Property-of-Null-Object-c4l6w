This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript. The bug arises from trying to access a property of a null object.  The `getElementById` method returns `null` if the element with the specified ID isn't found. Attempting to access a property of a `null` object causes a silent error, making debugging difficult for beginners.  The solution shows how to prevent this type of error by checking for `null` before accessing the properties.
